solving #1:
This was a fun realization on how the equation of the product PI breaks down in the heiarchy of the symbolic expression. This also solves the explanation for other problems presented in the course work given the patter of the concept at hand.
So the seegma of 4, k=1 in the expression "9i - 2k" goes as follows.

"9i-2(k=1) + 9i-2(k=2) + 9i-2(k=3) + 9i-2(k=4)"

above is the broken down expression for the seegma of 4/k=1 of 9i-2k.

the "coin" of the equation has to do with the k changing the value or incremented factorial of the value in the equation. so essentially this transcribes to 

"(9i-2)+(9i-4)+(9i-6)+(9i-8)" = "36i-20"

# CHAIN RULE Explained through ChatGPT
=======================================
To find the derivative of ln⁡(x2)ln(x2) with respect to xx, you can use the chain rule. The natural logarithm function is denoted by ln⁡(x)ln(x), and its derivative is 1/x​.

=========================================
Here's a general overview of derivatives:
=========================================
    # Definition:
    The derivative of a function y=f(x)y=f(x) with respect to xx is denoted as f′(x)f′(x) or dydxdxdy​. It represents the rate of change of yy with respect to xx.

    # Interpretation:
        Geometric Interpretation: At a given point on the graph of the function, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line.
        Physical Interpretation: In applications, the derivative often represents rates of change, velocities, accelerations, and more.

    # Mathematical Notation:
    The derivative can be expressed using different notations:
        f′(x)f′(x)
        dydxdxdy​
        lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hlimh→0​hf(x+h)−f(x)​

    # Rules for Finding Derivatives:
        Power Rule: If f(x)=xnf(x)=xn, then f′(x)=n⋅xn−1f′(x)=n⋅xn−1.
        Sum/Difference Rule: (g(x)±h(x))′=g′(x)±h′(x)(g(x)±h(x))′=g′(x)±h′(x).
        Product Rule: (g(x)⋅h(x))′=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x)(g(x)⋅h(x))′=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x).
        Quotient Rule: (g(x)h(x))′=g′(x)⋅h(x)−g(x)⋅h′(x)(h(x))2(h(x)g(x)​)′=(h(x))2g′(x)⋅h(x)−g(x)⋅h′(x)​.
        Chain Rule: If y=g(f(x))y=g(f(x)), then y′=g′(f(x))⋅f′(x)y′=g′(f(x))⋅f′(x).

    # Applications:
        Derivatives are used to analyze the behavior of functions, find maximum and minimum values, solve optimization problems, understand motion, and more.

    # Higher Order Derivatives:
        The second derivative, f′′(x)f′′(x) or d2ydx2dx2d2y​, represents the rate of change of the rate of change, and so on.
