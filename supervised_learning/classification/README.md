Asking ChatGPT about the features of a Neuron given the neural network, I searched for some of the more important questions concerning the Neuron's development. I was helped with a fellow Atlas School Student. These were the important parts of the development process to focus on 

=============================================================================================
"By considering these features and implementing them effectively, you can develop a well-performing neuron as part of a neural network for various machine learning tasks."


=========
Activation Function: Choose an appropriate activation function for the neuron. Common choices include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Leaky ReLU, etc. The choice of activation function affects the non-linearity and learning dynamics of the neural network.

Weights and Bias: Initialize weights and bias appropriately. Weights are typically initialized randomly, often from a normal distribution, and bias is usually initialized to zero.

Forward Propagation: Implement the forward propagation process, which involves computing the weighted sum of inputs, adding the bias, and applying the activation function to obtain the output of the neuron.

Backpropagation: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients of the loss function with respect to the neuron's parameters (weights and bias). These gradients are then used to update the parameters during training via optimization algorithms like gradient descent, Adam, RMSprop, etc.

Loss Function: Define an appropriate loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output of the neuron and the true target output. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), binary cross-entropy, categorical cross-entropy, etc.

===========================================================================================

There were a few other features that were important to the Neural Network and it's development that aren't focused on in this Classification project.

I provided these features below
==============================

Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the neural network.

Optimization: Choose an optimization algorithm and tune its hyperparameters to efficiently minimize the loss function during training. Hyperparameters include learning rate, momentum, batch size, etc.

Initialization: Experiment with different weight initialization techniques such as Xavier initialization, He initialization, etc., to ensure stable and effective training of the neural network.

Batch Processing: Implement batch processing to train the neural network on mini-batches of data rather than processing the entire dataset at once. This can improve training efficiency and convergence.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitor the training process by tracking metrics such as training loss, validation loss, accuracy, etc. Evaluate the performance of the trained neural network on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.
